### It's time to change the icon of your DiscordPTB client.

üßôüèª Starting today, you can change your **Discord PTB** icon on Windows to differentiate your other Discord clients.<br/>

1. Go to [Discord](https://discord.com/download).
2. Download the ["Public Test Build"](https://discord.com/api/downloads/distributions/app/installers/latest?channel=ptb&platform=win&arch=x86) version.
3. Now download the [.ico](https://github.com/Flaqeau/DiscordPTB-Icon/blob/main/app.ico) icon to your computer.
4. Place the ".ico" file in the root: %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\DiscordPTB
5. Right click on the "DiscordPTB" application and go to "Properties".
6. Go to the "Change icon" button and click it.
7. It will automatically give you the new icon you previously installed.<br/>

#### üòé From now on, you can differentiate your Discord Stable client from the Public Test Build version.<br/>
